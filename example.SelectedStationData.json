                "text": "I moved to this area roughly a decade ago. It occurred to me the other day that I've used this gas station to fill up my cars all but a handful of times. There are a few reasons for this:\n\n1. There are multiple filling lanes, so it's rarely difficult to find a pump.\n2. It's an easy location to get in and out of.\n3. The lot across from the station used to be a dilapidated house that sold Christmas Trees during the holiday season. Made for a nice area during the deep dark of the year. Now it's a Taco Time, which is pretty great too.\n4. The car wash is really easy to get into, even on busy days.\n\nFinally, here's a fun tip for anyone that's still reading: it's a good idea to keep the receipt of your last fill-up in the car until your next fill up. From time to time, gas station fuel basins get water in them. When the fuel trucks come to fill up the basins, the gas/water in the containers gets jostled and if you fill up right after, you can get a significant amount of water in your gas tank. This will damage your engine if you run that fuel. It's almost impossible to prove the gas station's liability, but if you keep your receipts, you'll have a much stronger case. Anyway, just a low-inconvenience, high-upside tip of the day.",
